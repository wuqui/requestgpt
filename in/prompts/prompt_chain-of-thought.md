Please use a chain of thought for classifying utterances:

1. Read the utterance.
2. Determine if the speaker is prompting the listener to a future action.
3. Determine if the future action brings advantages for the speaker.
4. If both criteria are met, label the utterance as a request (1). If not, label it as not a request (0).
